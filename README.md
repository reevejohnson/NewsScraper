# NewsScraper

This application uses Mongoose to create MongoDB models that store scraped Articles from the ENews Beyonc√© web page and corresponding Notes that the user can input. I employed Axios to scrape the headlines, links, and images. Mongoose helps to streamline the pushing and pulling to and from the Articles database.
